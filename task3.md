To gauge the level of detail evaluators typically expect, review this [task 3 example](https://westerngovernorsuniversity-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/jim_ashe_wgu_edu/EbuIx1Ufa8ZLpLkX-JTYg_kB23xYHTbAtxstp30M-00GSA?e=pGEnfI).

*Most* of task 3 will be updating task 2 from the future to the past tense. As such, task 3 should be similiar in length and detail to task 2. 

Differences are hightled in the [task 3 template](task3:template) and discussed in the video. You must update it as follows:

<div class = "tasklist">

   <input type="checkbox"> Update title page, TOC,  headers, and footers.

   <input type="checkbox"> Rewrite corresponding sections from task 2 in the past tense adjusting as necessary following the task 3 rubric. All dates should be in the past.

   <input type="checkbox"> Section [**B: Other Works**](task3:B) must be rewritten using **three** works different from those used in section B of task 2.

   <input type="checkbox"> For section [**F: Timeline**](task3:F), update the columns and dates from the task 2 timline table, and **write a narative** discussing how the timeline was met and any varainces.

   <input type="checkbox"> Write section [**G: Unaticipated Requirements**](task3:G). 

   <input type="checkbox"> For section [**H: Conclusion**](task3:H), revise *Outcomes* from task 2 discussing the results and effect of the completed project.

   <input type="checkbox"> For section [**I: Project Deliverables**](task3:I), add examples of deliverabels to the appendices.

   <input type="checkbox"> Following APA guidelines, [check grammar and sources](task2:sources), export as a pdf, and submit.

   <input type="checkbox"> Submit, pass, and graduate! 

</div>

```{warning}
Submission with missing sections are automatically returned. If everything went as planned, explain why. The a narrative following *Timeline* and an *Unanticapted Requirments* section are still required.   
```
(task3:A)=
## Section A: Overview
Revise [Task 2 section A3](task2:A) adjusting for any variances and providing a summary of the completed project. You can reuse any content from realted sections [C](task3:C) and [D](task3:D).

```{tip}
- Write this section last or return to it after writing after the Conclusion. 
- The required depth of detail is up to subjectivity of the evaluator. Though summaries are typically short, there is no penalty for *too much* detail. 
```

(task3:B)=
## Section B: Other Works
The requirements for this section are identical to that of [task 2 section B](task2:B) -only you must have **three** different from those in task 2 cited following [APA guidelines](task3:sources). 

(task3:C)
## Section C: Changes to Project Environment
Using sections [D](task2:D) and [E](task2:E) from task 2, describe how your project changed the client's environment. 

(task3:D)
## Section D: Methodology
