## Choosing a Topic

The approval form ensures you are headed in the right direction before investing time and effort into task 2. Evaluators look for our (instructors) signature, and we look for the following:

1. A *relation* to your degree emphasis.
2. A *specific* client and problem (you can fabricate a client whose problem needs your chosen solution.)
3. A [hard IT deliverable](task1-faq-hard) will be implemented as part of the solution to that problem.

## Topic Approval

Once you've decided on a topic, complete the approval form following the template:

> [![Topic Approval Form](https://westerngovernorsuniversity-my.sharepoint.com/personal/jim_ashe_wgu_edu/Documents/jupyter-books/C769/url_images/C769_t1_approval.png#image-thumb)](https://westerngovernorsuniversity-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/jim_ashe_wgu_edu/ES7B62K50FpKhgSwOZxgRVcByPT8r6oIWJDFrcpzpPNbqw?e=qWyM4D)


Include a rough outline of your client, their problem(s), and your IT plan to fix it. **Email the completed form to your course instructor** who will either sign it or provide feedback.

```{note}
The topic approval form must be *signed by a C769 course instructor*. Forms without a signature are automatically returned without further review.  
```

Directly emailing your assigned course instructor is the fastest and often best way to get a signature. Whether emailing [ugcapstoneit@wgu.ed](mailto:ugcapstoneit@wgu.edu?cc=my%20course%20instructor&subject=C769:%20capstone%20topic%20approval) or your CI directly, always practice profressional communication:
* Use your WGU email.
* Provide a subject, your capstone course, and your program mentor's name (if not in your signature)
* Clearly state your questions or requests. 

## Waiver Form

Everyone must submit a waiver form stating either their project is not base on restricted information OR use of any restricted information is authorized.  

> [![Waiver Form](https://westerngovernorsuniversity-my.sharepoint.com/personal/jim_ashe_wgu_edu/Documents/IT%20courses%20-WGU%20onedrive/C769/linked%20resources%20for%20students/769_waiver_form_thumb-1.png#image-thumb)](https://westerngovernorsuniversity-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/jim_ashe_wgu_edu/EUNAmf7lWqxOmKBLWTQ_zPcByoxrOLLK5sILQeeUoeYGeQ?e=9d1Ef7) 

In most cases, obtaining authorization can be avoided by fabricating information or masking identifiying information.

## FAQ

**Do I need to setup an appointment to get approval?**

No. Usually students email the approval form to their instructor. We then sign to form or follow up with questions. However, if you have questions about the requirements or difficulty choosing a topic, you are encouraged to set up an appointment. Most questions and concerns can be addressed in a 15-30 minute call. 

**What if I start writing task 2 and want to change what was approved in task 1, do I need to resubmit task 1?** 

No, not unless it's a completely different topic. Minor changes from task 1 to task 2 are common and allowed *without updating the approval form*. Evaluators will not rigorously compare tasks 1 and 2. Task 2 is where the work is, and even with complete topic changes at most you'llbe asked to revise the approval form (if at all). So never let task 1 dictate what you do in task 2.    

**Can I use projects from other WGU courses?**

You can use any of your own work or academic projects (at WGU or elsewhere) provided no proprietary information is used without permission. Don't worry about self-plagarism as the similarity check will identify and ignore it. Just as in resusing work projects, expect to modify and remold past academic projects so as to meet the rubric requireements.


**Do I need an "electronic signature" as specified in the official rubric?**

You can type in your name, use a "fancy" font, or insert a an image of your signature.  

**What are the common reasons for task 1 being returned?**

1. No instructor signature on the approval form. You need to send it to us and get a signature *before* submitting it.
2. Two or no boxes being clearly marked on the waiver form. Mark one and only one box. 

**How many attempts are allowed for each assessment?**

You have unlimited attempts. However, submissions which are incomplete or signifcantly fall short of the minimal requirements may be *locked* from further submissions without instructor approval. Furthermore, such submissions do not receive meaningful evaluator comments. 

(task1-faq-hard)=
**What is a hard IT deliverable?**

It is a physical or digital technological addition or improvement to the client's environment. Examples include any hardware or softwate installation or updates. *Soft deliverables,* e.g., training, policies, evaluation, etc., can (and often should) be included but cannot meet the requirements alone.
