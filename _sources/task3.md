Write your conclusion report following the template, **Task 3: The Conclusion**:

To gauge the level of detail evaluators typically expect, review this [task 3 example](https://westerngovernorsuniversity-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/jim_ashe_wgu_edu/EbuIx1Ufa8ZLpLkX-JTYg_kB23xYHTbAtxstp30M-00GSA?e=pGEnfI).

*Most* of task 3 will update task 2 from the future to the past tense. As such, task 3 should be similar in length and detail to task 2. Differences are highlighted in the [task 3 template](task3:template) and discussed in the video. You must update task 2 as follows:
<div class = "tasklist">

   <input type="checkbox"> Update title page, TOC,  headers, and footers.

   <input type="checkbox"> Rewrite corresponding sections from task 2 in the past tense adjusting as necessary following the task 3 rubric. All dates should be in the past.

   <input type="checkbox"> Section [B: Other Works](task3:B) must have **three** new sources different from those in section B of task 2.

   <input type="checkbox"> Write section [G: Unanticipated Requirements](task3:G). 

   <input type="checkbox"> For section [H: Conclusion](task3:H), revise *Outcomes* from task 2, discussing the results and effectiveness of the completed project.

   <input type="checkbox"> For section [I: Project Deliverables](task3:I), add examples of deliverables to the appendices.

   <input type="checkbox"> Following APA guidelines, [check grammar and sources](task2:sources), export as a pdf, and submit.

   <input type="checkbox"> Submit, pass, and graduate! 

</div>

```{warning}
Submissions with missing sections are automatically returned. If everything went as planned, explain why. The narrative following the *Timeline* and an *Unanticapted Requirments* section is still required.   
```

(task3:A)=
## Section A: Overview
Revise [Task 2 section A3](task2:A), adjusting for any variances and providing a summary of the completed project. In addition, you can reuse any content from related task 3 sections [C](task3:C) and [D](task3:D).

```{tip}
- Write this section last or return to it after writing the Conclusion. 
- The required depth of detail is up to the subjectivity of the evaluator. Though summaries are typically short, there is no penalty for *too much* detail. 
```

(task3:B)=
## Section B: Other Works
The requirements for this section are identical to that of [task 2 section B](task2:B) -only you must have **three** works different from those in task 2 cited following [APA guidelines](task3:sources), e.g., (Author year). 

(task3:C)=
## Section C: Changes to Project Environment
Using task 2 sections [D](task2:D) and [E](task2:E) from task 2, describe how your project changed the client's environment. 

(task3:D)
## Section D: Methodology
Adding any variations, revise [task 2 section E](task2:E) from task 2 from the future to the past tense.

(task3:E)=
## Section E: Project Goals and Objectives
Discuss how successfully completed goals and objectives from (task2:F) were met. *If* any goals or objectives were not met, discuss why.  

(task3:F)
## Section F: Project Timeline
1. Update the timeline table from [task 2 section G](task2:G) with columns for *Planned Duration*, *Actual Duration*, *Actual Start Date*, and *Actual End Date*.

|Milestone or Deliverable  |Planned Duration  | Actual Duration  | Actual Start Date| Actual End date
--- | --- | ---| ---| ---|
|Some milestones |7 days|7 days|7/23/2022|7/30/2022|
|Some deliverables |14 days|10 days|7/18/2022|7/28/2022|
|$\vdots$ |$\vdots$ |$\vdots$ |$\vdots$ |$\vdots$ |

```{note}
*All* dates must be in the past. Task 3 is a conclusion report. Write as if you recently completed the project -even if the dates do not align with the task 2 projected end dates. Evaluators understand this is a written exercise, and academic timelines rarely sync with real-world timelines. 
```

2. Following the updated timeline, write a narrative explaining any differences from the projected proposal timeline, [task 2 section G](task2:G). If there were no variances, explain why.

```{warning}
Do **not** leave this section blank. It is easy to overlook, but submissions with no timeline narrative will not be accepted. 
```

(task3:G)=
## Section G: Unanticipated Requirements

Describe any unanticipated requirements and how you dealt with them. You should repeat anything from the narrative section of [Task 3 section F](task3:F). If everything went as planned (which is a tad unrealistic), explain why. Do not leave this section blank.  

(task3:H)=
## Section H: Conclusion

Summarize the results and potential effects of your completed project compared to the expected outcomes outlined in [task 2 section H](task3:H).  

(task3:I)=
## Section I: Deliverables

You must include at least **two** things you created, e.g., network maps, webpages, scripts, training certificates/questions, etc. They can be fabricated entirely, examples, or parts of actual deliverables. 

```{tip}
If reusing materials from an open source or actual project, mask any identifying information.

## Sources and Grammar

:::{warning}
Grammar and sources are the *most common* reason for returned submission! However, even minor grammatical errors can prevent a submission from passing.
:::

After focusing on content, check your grammar using [Grammarly.com](https://www.grammarly.com/)![](c:/Users/Jim/Downloads/grammarly.png=25x25) üìù (it's what the evaluators use). Style is not assessed (blue and green), but even a few grammar mistakes will prevent competency in *Professional Communication*. The free side has been sufficient, but if using the online app, you sometimes need to wait before mistakes are caught. 

```{warning}
Students have reported missed mistakes when using the Google doc Grammarly extension. We advise that you copy and paste it into the online app or purchase the premium version for MS. 
```

For sources, you should follow [APA guidelines](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines). Avoid errors by using the [MS Word Reference Tool](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-a-bibliography-citations-and-references-17686589-4824-4940-9c69-342c289fa2a5) to create and manage references.

## FAQ

**What are the most common reasons task 3 does not pass?**

The most common reasons for returned task 3's:
1)	Grammar 
2)	Sources 
3)	No narrative for [part F, Project Timeline](task3:F).
4) Insufficient details for section X.

1-3 are easily avoidable. Being cited for "insufficient details" is a matter of subjectivity, but it is also easy to fix -just add more details. As task 3 mostly implements the already passed plan of task 2 -it is mostly already passed.   

**How long should task 3 be?**

Review the [task 3 example](task3:example). As task 3 mainly rewrites task, task 3 is typically similar in length. They will assess task 3 independently of task 2. Don't assume they'll compare the two.  

**My capstone is not a real project. What do I do for the deliverables?**

See [section I](task3:I). You only need to provide *examples* of actual deliverables you might provide to clients demonstrating a project's completion. 

**My task 2 timeline has projected end dates of 6 months (since this is what it would take), but I just submitted task 2 and need to complete task 3 now. What should I do?** 

Evaluators understand this is a written exercise, and academic timelines rarely sync with real-world timelines. *Write as if you recently completed the project -even if the dates do not align with the task 2 projected end dates. 

**I've completed task 3, but task 2 is still in the assessment queue. Should I wait until task 2 passes before I submit task 2?**

If you're nearing the end of term, you should submit task 3 as soon as it's ready. If task 2 gets returned, task 3 will also automatically be returned. However, if it passes, task 3 will keep its place in the assessment queue.
