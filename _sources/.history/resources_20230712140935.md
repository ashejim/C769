## Examples

These examples are more on-par with average passing tasks. Use them as guidelines (every project is different) for what evaluators accept in fulfillment of the requirements.

````{tab-item} Example set 1

### Excellence Archive

The [Capstone Excellence Archive](https://westerngovernorsuniversity.sharepoint.com/sites/capstonearchives/excellence/Pages/UndergraduateInformation.aspx) includes a wide range of completed projects. When reviewing archived capstones, keep in mind that they all are, by definition, *above and beyond* the requirements. Therefore, do not use these as examples of what's needed to meet the requirements. For a more down-to-earth example of what's required, see the above [Examples](resources:examples) section.

### Grammarly.com

Check your grammar using [Grammarly.com](https://www.grammarly.com/) ![grammarly_icon](https://github.com/ashejim/C769/blob/main/url_images/icon-grammarly.png?raw=true#icon) (it's what the evaluators use). Style is not assessed (Grammarly marks these in blue, green, or purple), but even a few grammar errors (marked in red) will prevent competency in *Professional Communication*. The free side has been sufficient, but if using the online app, you sometimes need to wait before mistakes are caught.

:::{warning}
Students have reported missed mistakes when using the Google doc Grammarly extension. Therefore, we advise copying content directly into the app or purchasing the premium version compatible with MS Word.

### Welcome email

We've tried to provide everything you need here on this website as a more complete and readily available resource than the "welcome email," i.e., the *non-automated* introductory email from your assigned course instructor containing the tips and resources needed to get started in the right direction. However, we often get asked for the email, and I suppose this website would be incomplete without it. So here is an example of a "welcome email."

```{admonition} A Welcome Email

```{warning}
Be aware that task 2 and 3 evaluations often take the full three days. Therefore, if you are approaching the end of your term, don't wait on task 2 to start task 3 and submit task 3 early enough to have it returned, revised, and resubmitted.
```
