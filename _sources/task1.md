## Choosing a Topic

The approval form ensures you start in the right direction before investing time and effort into task 2. Evaluators look for our ([instructors'](ci_page)) signature, and we look for the following:

1. *Relation* to your degree emphasis.
2. A *specific* client and problem (you can fabricate a client whose problem needs your chosen solution.)
3. The implementation of a [hard IT deliverable](task1:faq:hard) solving that problem.

```{margin} What is hard IT deliverable?
A  *hard IT deliverable* is a physical or digital technological improvement to the client's environment. Examples include any hardware or software installation or updates. *Soft deliverables*, e.g., training, policies, evaluation, etc., can (and often should) be included but cannot meet the requirements alone.

The [Capstone Excellence Archive](https://westerngovernorsuniversity.sharepoint.com/sites/capstonearchives/excellence/Pages/UndergraduateInformation.aspx) includes a wide range of completed projects to review. However, keep in mind that they all are, by definition, *above and beyond* the requirements. Therefore, do not use these as examples of what's needed to meet the requirements. For a more down-to-earth example of what's required, see these examples:

- [tasks 1-3](resources:examples)

## Topic Approval

Once you've decided on a topic, complete the approval form following the template:

> [![Topic Approval Form](https://github.com/ashejim/C769/blob/main/url_images/C769_t1_approval.png?raw=true#image-thumb)](https://westerngovernorsuniversity-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/jim_ashe_wgu_edu/ES7B62K50FpKhgSwOZxgRVcByPT8r6oIWJDFrcpzpPNbqw?e=qWyM4D)

Include a rough outline of your client, their problem(s), and your IT plan to fix it. **Email the completed form to** **[your course instructor](ci_page)** who will either approve it with their signature or provide feedback.

```{note}
The topic approval form must be *signed by a* *[C769 course instructor](ci_page)*. Forms without a signature are automatically returned without further review.  
```

Directly emailing your assigned course instructor is the fastest and often best way to get a signature. Whether emailing [ugcapstoneit@wgu.edu](mailto:ugcapstoneit@wgu.edu?cc=my%20course%20instructor&subject=C769:%20capstone%20topic%20approval&body=Your%20name%20and%20question%20here.%20We%20can%20only%20respond%20to%20messages%20from%20a%20valid%20WGU%20email%20address.%20%0A%0ADegree%20program%3A%20%0AProgram%20Mentor%3A%20%0A) or your CI directly, always practice professional communication:
* Use your WGU email.
* Provide a subject, your capstone course, and your program mentor's name (if not in your signature)
* Clearly state your questions or requests. 

## Waiver Form

Everyone must submit a waiver form stating either their project is not based on restricted information OR use of any restricted information is authorized. 

> [![Waiver Form](https://github.com/ashejim/C769/blob/main/url_images/769_waiver_form_thumb-1.png?raw=true#image-thumb)](https://westerngovernorsuniversity-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/jim_ashe_wgu_edu/EUNAmf7lWqxOmKBLWTQ_zPcByoxrOLLK5sILQeeUoeYGeQ?e=9d1Ef7) 

In most cases, obtaining authorization can be avoided by fabricating or masking identifying information.

## FAQ

**Do I need to set up an appointment to get approval?**

No. Usually, students email the approval form to their instructor. We then sign to form or follow up with questions. However, if you have questions about the requirements or difficulty choosing a topic, you are encouraged to set up an appointment with [your course instructor](ci_page). A 15-30 minute phone call can address most questions or concerns. 

**What if I start writing task 2 and want to change things? Do I need to resubmit task 1?** 

No, not unless it's an entirely different topic. Minor changes from task 1 to task 2 are expected and allowed *without updating the approval form*. Evaluators will not rigorously compare tasks 1 and 2. Task 2 is where the work is, and even with complete topic changes at most, you'll be asked to revise the approval form (if at all). So never let task 1 dictate what you do in task 2.    

**Can I use projects from other WGU courses?**

Yes! You can use any of your work or academic projects (at WGU or elsewhere) provided no proprietary information is used without permission. Don't worry about self-plagiarism, as the similarity check will identify and ignore it. Just as in reusing work projects, expect to modify and remold past academic assignments to meet the rubric requirements.

**Do I need an "electronic signature" as specified in the official rubric?**

You can type in your name, use a "fancy" font, or insert an image of your signature.  

**What are the common reasons for task 1 being returned?**

1. No instructor signature on the approval form. You need to send it to us and get a signature *before* submitting it.
2. Both or no boxes are correctly marked on the waiver form. *Mark one and only one box*. 

**How many attempts are allowed for each assessment?**

You have unlimited attempts. However, incomplete submissions or submissions significantly falling short of the minimum requirements may be *locked* from further submissions without instructor approval. Furthermore, such submissions do not receive meaningful evaluator comments. 

(task1:faq:hard)=
**What is a hard IT deliverable?**

It is a physical or digital technological addition or improvement to the client's environment. Examples include any hardware or software installation or updates. *Soft deliverables*, e.g., training, policies, evaluation, etc., can (and often should) be included but cannot meet the requirements alone.
