:::{note}
Students starting C769 8/25/2024 may automatically be enrolled in the newest version, ROM3. The ROM3 requirements are very similar to ROM2. However, faculty could only review the new course after its release, and there are minor discrepancies between the latest course and our stated best practices. We will update ROM3 resources as time allows.

Please discuss your options with your program mentor. C769 course faculty cannot adjust which version you are assigned.
