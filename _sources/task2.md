# Task 2

Write your proposal following the **Task 2: The Proposal template**:
> [![Task 2: the Proposal template](https://westerngovernorsuniversity-my.sharepoint.com/personal/jim_ashe_wgu_edu/Documents/jupyter-books/C769/url_images/t2_template_thumb.png#image-thumb)](https://westerngovernorsuniversity-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/jim_ashe_wgu_edu/EXQpEzeuOBhBnfhO15di-mQBXkj592jBHZ0ceFGcdVdvJA?e=y0cZTs)

To gauge the level of detail evaluators typically expect, review this [task 2 example](https://westerngovernorsuniversity-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/jim_ashe_wgu_edu/Edh7No2A3uhAtlXnmQYuJMIBQO6pJE0xOe8m4J_J0n6wdg?e=p1haS7) - this is a passing albeit not 
great project. 

<div class = "tasklist">

   <input type="checkbox"> Pass [**task 1**](task1). 

   <input type="checkbox"> Watch *all* of the [**Task 2 videos**](resources:task2) (they are short). 
   
   <input type="checkbox"> Watch a section's video, review the corresponding task 2 section, and then write that section to independenty meet the rubric requirements. Here's a *suggested* order:

   <div class = "tasklist2">

   <input type="checkbox"> Watch the video, read the example, and write [D: Current Environment](task2:D). 

   <input type="checkbox"> Watch the video, read the example, and write [F: Goals, Objectives, and deliverable](task2:F). 
   
   <input type="checkbox"> Watch the video, read the example, and write [G: Timeline](task2:F).
   
   <input type="checkbox"> Watch the video, read the example, and write [E: Methodology](task2:E).

   <input type="checkbox"> Watch the video, read the example, and write [D: Rationale](task2:D).
   
   <input type="checkbox"> Watch the video, read the example, and write [H: Outcome](task2:H).

   <input type="checkbox"> Watch the video, read the example, and write [A: Overview](task2:A) (review and reuse content from D, C, and E). 

   <input type="checkbox"> Watch the video, read the example, and write [B: Other Works](task2:B). 

   </div>

   <input type="checkbox"> Following APA guidelines, [check grammar and sources](task2:sources), export as a pdf, and submit.

:::{tip}
Sections are assessed independently against the rubric requirements, i.e., when evaluating a section the evaluator will check for fulfillment of the requirements only within that section. Writing style *is not* assessed. You can resuse content from other sections as needed. It's not about writing something fun to read -it's about the requirements are clearly met.

(task2:A)=
## Sections A1, A2, and A3: Overview

:::{sidebar}
<iframe src="https://wgu.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=db8381ab-1659-49e9-b5fc-ebb844c66944&autoplay=false&offerviewer=true&showtitle=true&showbrand=true&captions=true&interactivity=all" title="A1, A2, anb A3: The Proposal" style="border: 1px solid #464646;" class="center" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay">
</iframe>
:::

The Proposal Overview has three parts: 
1. The Problem Summary 
2. The IT Solution
3. The Implementation Plan. 

It is not assessed, but you are writing for an uninformed reader -the client in need of your expertise. You should explain what's wrong with their situation, why your solution is the fix, and how that solution will be put into place. 

<!-- Keeping an uninformed reader in mind may help you understand why the Proposal Overview could extend for several pages. Imagine explaining the project to a non-technical friend. Adopting more accessible language requires explaining terms and concepts normally taken for granted which creates content. Also, WGU evaluators know nothing about the problem at hand, the organizational environment in which it exists, what might or might not work as a solution, or how the solution should best be implemented for the greatest chance of success. These sections introduce them to your project and provide the context by which they assess other areas     -->

```{tip}
- Write these sections last or return to them after writing each subsequent section to ensure your overview accurately summarizes your project. 
- The required depth of detail is up to subjectivity of the evaluator. Though summaries are typically short, there is no penalty for *too much* detail
```

(task2:B)=
## Sections B and B1: Review of Other Work & Relations of Artifacts

:::{sidebar}
<iframe src="https://wgu.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=84af12b9-96da-41dc-b9ee-ac400141ba80&autoplay=false&offerviewer=true&showtitle=true&showbrand=true&captions=true&interactivity=all" title="B and B1: Other Works" style="border: 1px solid #464646;" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay" class="center" >
</iframe>
:::

Think of this section as a literature review where you first summarize a work (part B) and then relate it to your project (B1). The works only need to connect to an aspect of your project; they don't need to align with it entirely, and you can use anything produced by an industry professional, e.g., online articles, whitepapers, techincal documentation, etc. This section must have **four** different works cited following [APA guidelines](task2:sources). Normally, a proposal would cite sources as needed, but for evaluation purposes a single section demonstraing research was needed. 

:::{tip}
Stuck? Comeback to this section later. You should conduct research while writing other sections collecting sources connected to your project along the way. Hang on to any extra sources as you'll need three diffent works for Task 3.

## Sections C and D: Rationale and Current Envrionment

:::{sidebar}
<iframe src="https://wgu.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=1fff04ae-4974-4999-b147-7fcb8d934904&autoplay=false&offerviewer=true&showtitle=true&showbrand=true&captions=true&interactivity=all" title="C and D: Rationale & Current Envrionment" style="border: 1px solid #464646;" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay" class="center">
</iframe>
:::

(task2:C)=
### Rationale
The **Project Rationale** provides a comprehensize picture of *why* the project is needed. Describe the business, technical, and/or user needs. Internal and external environmentals factors might also be included. 

(task2:D)=
### Current Environment
In **Current Project Environment**, describe:
1. The client's current state, e.g. numbwer of employess, tech, software, etc.
2. What's wrong the client's current state.
3. Why your solution fixes it.

:::{tip}
Sections are checked against the rubric requirements *individually*. So when the rubirc is redundant -*be redundant* adding appropiate detail or emphasis.  
:::

## Sections E and F: Methodology & Goals...

:::{sidebar}
<iframe src="https://wgu.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=e3d9d9d5-03c9-425f-abff-ac4c015c1410&autoplay=false&offerviewer=true&showtitle=true&showbrand=true&captions=true&interactivity=all" title="E and F: Methodology & Goals" style="border: 1px solid #464646;" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay" class ="center">
</iframe>
:::

(task2:E)=
### Methodology

In this section, you must
1. Identify a "standard" methodology, e.g., ADDIE or SLDC, used to plan the project.
2. Describe what project steps are to be completed in each phase of the methodology, e.g., analysis, design, etc. 
Step 2 will provide a detailed implmentation plan outline in section A2. If using a less known methodology, relate it to a "standard" methodology. 

(task2:F)=
### Goals, Objects, & Deliverables

For this section,
1. Provide a table outlining project goals, objects, and deliverables.
2. Separate from the table, describe each listed goal and objective.

**Goals** and **objectives** are very similar. Goals are broader defining the end result you are trying to achieve (e.g., improving customer service). Objectives are more specific, often measurable steps supporting the goal (e.g., real-time invetory updates for customers). Goals and objective can be thought of as high-level and midmanagement tasks respectively. **Deliverables** are tangible tasks completed supporting the objectives (e.g., an inventory status screen reporting real-time inventory to customers).

## Sections G and H: Timeline & Outcomes

:::{sidebar}
<iframe src="https://wgu.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=a1daad4d-43f7-40e5-86be-ab7fe69ab76b&autoplay=false&offerviewer=true&showtitle=true&showbrand=true&captions=true&interactivity=all" title="G and H: Timeline & Outcome" frameborder="0" style="border: 1px solid #464646;" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay" class ="center">
</iframe>
:::

(task2:G)=
### Project Timeline with Milestones

Create a table providing *Duration*, *Projected start date*, and *Anticipated end date,* for each milestone and deliverable. No additional information is needed. 

|Milestone or Deliverable  |Duration  | Projected Start Date| Projected End date
--- | --- | ---| ---|
|Some milestone|7 days|7/23/2022|7/30/2022|
|Some deliverable|14 days|7/16/2022|7/30/2022|
|$\vdots$ |$\vdots$ |$\vdots$ |$\vdots$ |

(task2:H)=
### Outcome

Provide objective, measurable criteria for success. You need specific details so that the conclusion report, task 3, can compartiviely be used to show the project was a success. Time-based metrics work best, for example, from page 18 of the [task 2 example](https://westerngovernorsuniversity-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/jim_ashe_wgu_edu/Edh7No2A3uhAtlXnmQYuJMIBQO6pJE0xOe8m4J_J0n6wdg?e=p1haS7),
>...This project will be considered a success when the wireless network maintains has maintained 90% uptime a week for a month and when 75% of new member and loan documentationis processed over the credit union {cite:p}`task_2_example`.

(task2:sources)=
## Sources and Grammar

:::{warning}
Grammar and sources are the *most common* reason for returned submission! Even small grammatical errors can prevent a submission from passing.
:::

After, focusing on content, check your grammar using [Grammarly.com](https://www.grammarly.com/)![](c:/Users/Jim/Downloads/grammarly.png=25x25) 📝 (it's what the evaluators use). Style is not assessed (blue and green), but even a few grammar mistakes will prevent competency in *Professional Communication*. The free side has been sufficient, but if using the online app you sometimes need to wait before mistakes are caught. 

For sources, you should follow [APA guidelines](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines). Avoid errors by using the [MS Word Reference Tool](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-a-bibliography-citations-and-references-17686589-4824-4940-9c69-342c289fa2a5) to create and manage references.

## FAQ
**I've completed task 2. Should I send it to my course instructror for review?** 

Given the subkectivity involved

**The task 2 template has suggested page lengths. Are these lengths required?**

No. Those are just suggestions. What qualifies as "suffiecient detail" is determined by the individual evaluator and will vary depending on the project and writing style. If you feel you've met the requirments, simply move on to the next submissision. Upon submission, it will either pass, or they will request more details.

**How many submissions attempts do I have?**
You have unlimited submissions (as with all WGU performance assessments). Furthermore, project requiring multiple submissions are not precluded from being given an excellence award. However, do attempt to fully meet *each* requirement as submissions falling signifcantly short of the minimal requirements may be *locked* from further submissions without instructor approval. Morevoer, such submissions do not receive meaningful evaluator comments.   

**I can't find sources for section B, *Other Works*. What can I do?**
You are likely overinterpeting what's required. Rarely are submisison sent back because cited works are unsuitable. You can use referenceable work created by a professional which can be *related* to your project -it does not need to align with your project entirely. For example, a cloud migration project might include articles about AWS, secuirty advantages, cost advantages, etc. 


**My task two was returned for *sources* stating:**
> "In-text citations could not be found for portions of the task that have been quoted or paraphrased,... "

**What does this comment mean?**

This indicates they could not find a matching in-text citation for every source on your reference list. Check that each reference has a match following APA style, e.g., (Author, year), and remove any references without matches. Avoid errors by using the [MS Word Reference Tool](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-a-bibliography-citations-and-references-17686589-4824-4940-9c69-342c289fa2a5) to create and manage references.
