# Welcome to C769!

Welcome! The IT capstone is a written project demonstrating competency in your field through communicating the planning and implementing of an IT solution to a business problem.

The capstone includes three parts:
1. **Task One:** Getting course instructor topic approval -a preliminary step to ensure you started in the right direction.
2. **Task two:** The Proposal -a detailed paper describing a client's problem and how you will implement an IT solution to solve it. Most of your work will be here.
3. **Task three:** The Conclusion Report -a detailed paper describing the concluded project proposed in task two. Most of task three repeats task two.

As task 3, the Reoort, involves *mostly* rewritting the Proposal, task 2 represents 70-80% of the caspsone work. For a more indepth understanding of this crucial task, view the section by section explanation of tasks 2: [](resources:task2) and how to write task 3 [](resources:task3)
