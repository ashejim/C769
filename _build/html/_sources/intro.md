# Welcome to C769!

Welcome! The IT capstone is a written project demonstrating competency in your field through communicating the planning and implementation of an IT solution to a business problem.

The capstone includes three parts:
1. **Task One:** Get course instructor topic approval -a preliminary step to ensure you started in the right direction.
2. **Task two:** The Proposal -a detailed paper describing a client's problem and how you will implement an IT solution to solve it. Most of your work will be here.
3. **Task three:** The Conclusion Report -a detailed paper describing the concluded project proposed in task two. Most of task three repeats task two.

## Start Here

First, understand the project's requirements. What they are -and what they aren't. Watch the following video:

Task 3, the Report, *mostly* rewrites the Proposal, task 2. Hence, task 2 represents 80-90% of the capstone work. For a more in-depth understanding of this crucial task, view the section-by-section [videos explaining task 2](resources:task2) and the [video on writing task 3](resources:task3).

## Welcome Email

We've tried to provide everything you need here on this website as a more complete and readily available resource than the "welcome email," i.e., the *non-automated* introductory email from your assigned course instructor containing the tips and resources needed to get started in the right direction. However, we often get asked for the email, and I suppose this website would be incomplete without it. So here is an example of a "welcome email."

```{admonition} A Welcome Email
Welcome to C769! See the [C769 IT Capstone website (this website)](https://ashejim.github.io/C769/intro.html) for almost everything you need. 

To understand what the capstone requires, watch [Choosing a project idea](https://wgu.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=691a0e9a-d33b-48ca-aac3-d7413f4bbfdc) and [Capstone Proposal Overview](https://wgu.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=db8381ab-1659-49e9-b5fc-ebb844c66944). Your first step is [choosing a topic](task1:chooseatopic); we recommend a topic proposing a technical solution to a problem -avoiding those that deliver only information (i.e., reports, policies, plans, training, etc.). Though they often need reframing to fit the capstone requirements, past or present work projects make great capstone topics.  

Follow this **Project Checklist** 

 - There is a plainly stated business need/problem for a *specific* client. Include details of a *specific* client's environment and problem. 
 - The topic proposes a solution specific to the needs of the client. It is not descriptive (how to do something), prescriptive >(the best way to do something), or strictly a research project.  
 - Though this is a wholly written exercise (an actual project is not required), fabricated projects must be indistinguishable from reality, and former work/school projects may need adjusting.  
 - The proposed project is related to your program emphasis. The scope may include other elements, but at least one aspect must be relatable to your programâ€™s emphasis. 
 - Your solution must include the implementation of a *[hard deliverable](task1:faq:hard), e.g., hardware/software*. Soft deliverables (training, plans, evaluation, policies, etc.) can also be included but cannot meet the requirements alone. 

**Task 1**  
 1. Understand what the project requires and doesn't require! Watch the videos in the [Task 1 and 2 resources](resources:task1:overviewvideo) section and review these [topic approval, task 2, and task 3 examples](resources:examples). An appointment is *not* required but is encouraged if you have general questions or need guidance. 
 2. Write the topic approval follwoing the [topic approval form](task1:topicapproval) This document should provide a rough outline summarizing your proposed project. Changes from task 1 to task 2 are allowed and typical; evaluators will not rigorously task 1 and 2. 
 3. Use [Grammarly.com](resources:grammar:grammarly), clearly mark the IRB statement, and email it to [your course instructor](ci_page) for their signature. Appointments before approval are *not* required but are encouraged if you have concerns. 
 4. Fill out the [IT Capstone Waiver form](task1:waiverform), and submit it along with the signed topic approval form to assessments. 
 
Afterward, start [task 2](task2) -the proposal. For tasks 1, 2, and 3 you can find templates, pacing guides, and more here: the [C769 IT Capstone website](https://ashejim.github.io/C769/intro.html).
