## Examples

These examples are on-par with average passing tasks. Use them as a guideline for what evaluators accept in fulfillment of the requirements.

### Excellence Archive

The [Capstone Excellence Archive](https://westerngovernorsuniversity.sharepoint.com/sites/capstonearchives/excellence/Pages/UndergraduateInformation.aspx) includes a wide range of completed projects. When reviewing archived capstones, keep in mind that they all are, by definition, *above and beyond* the requirements. Therefore, do not use these as examples of what's needed to meet the requirements. For a more down-to-earth example of what's required, see the above [Examples](resources:examples) section.
