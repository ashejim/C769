# Help Support this Website

This website is a collaborative work in progress by the C769 course faculty. However, we have NO official time or financial incentives for our efforts. Hence everything is developed slowly in our spare time. 

How can you help? Feedback! Tell us what we're doing right and what needs improvement. With your help, we can build this into the best possible resource for helping students. Here's how you can contribute:

- Leave a [comment below](support:comments) and/or :star: our [repo](https://ashejim.github.io/C769/support_this_page.html) (you'll need a GitHub account).
- Go to your C769 COS page and click 'Course Feedback.'
